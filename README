Hello World for Sqlite databases on WebOS
-------------------------------------------

Need the WebOS PDK installed. 

Depending on your configuration, You are going to need to modify the Makefile to 
point to the PDK libs and include files.

This project includes the sqlite-3 source code, under src/sqlite-3.  This is only to 
make the build process easier for me.  The better solution is to have a static library 
of sqlite included in the project.

This has been tested on a pre 2 cross compiled on mas os 10.6.

Let me know if you have any questions.
